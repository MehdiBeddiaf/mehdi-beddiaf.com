Hi there, I'm Mehdi Beddiaf a.k.a. Ninjarab.

I'm a software engineer and over the past couple of years I was used to write some JavaScript code, more precisely some
React.

As I hate staying in my zone of comfort and with a constant need of intellectual stimulation, I was looking for something
new to learn, use and above all enjoy on a daily basis.

Seeing more and more tweets, blog posts and conferences about functional programming, this paradigm caught my attention.

Hence, the purpose of this blog is to keep a record of what I've learned and I'm still learning about my journey into FP
and Purescript.

Oh, by the way, I like dinosaurs, Formula 1, powerlifting and traveling.

Wanna chat? You can e-mail me at mehdi.beddiaf@gmail.com.
