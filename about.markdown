Hi there, I'm Mehdi Beddiaf a.k.a. Ninjarab.

Learning functional programming is a long journey, I started with React and I
carried on with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/). Then I decided to step up my
game by learning [PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/) and
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), [Stk](https://github.com/Ninjarab/stk)
is one of my learning material among others making me appreciate every step
along the way...

Hence, the purpose of this blog is to keep a record of what I've learned and I'm
still learning about my journey into FP and
[PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/).

Oh, by the way, I like dinosaurs, Formula 1, powerlifting and traveling.
