      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Hi there, I’m Mehdi Beddiaf a.k.a. Ninjarab.</p>
<p>I’m a software engineer and over the past couple of years I was used to write some JavaScript code, more precisely some React.</p>
<p>As I hate staying in my zone of comfort and with a constant need of intellectual stimulation, I was looking for something new to learn, use and above all enjoy on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Seeing more and more tweets, blog posts and conferences about functional programming, this paradigm caught my attention.</p>
<p>Hence, the purpose of this blog is to keep a record of what I’ve learned and I’m still learning about my journey into FP and Purescript.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, I like dinosaurs, Formula 1, powerlifting and traveling.</p>
<p>Wanna chat? You can e-mail me at mehdi.beddiaf@gmail.com.</p>
